# Modelling Financial Risk with <del>  R  </del> Python
This is my code repository from "Modelling financial Risk with R" labs at SGH Warsaw School of Economics. The code is in Python as I don't like R. Feel free to use it!

You can find the original code in R here: https://web.sgh.waw.pl/~mrubas/ -> Teaching -> Modelling Financial Risk with R
